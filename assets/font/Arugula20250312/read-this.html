If you have spent more than USD 20 on this font then i can offer
a free glyph.
At your request i will design a glyph of your choice and add it
to the font.
Simply e-mail me at drj@pobox.com with proof of purchase.
This offer is subject to somewhat vague but reasonable
terms:
the glyph must be a standard unicode character not
already in the font;
it must be consistent with the general style and script coverage
of the font.
i will not be drawing Hanzi characters in a Latin script font.
